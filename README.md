A line follower robot is a type of autonomous robot that follows a line on the ground using sensors and motor control. In this particular project, the following components are used:
1. Arduino Uno
2. L298N motor driver
3. infrared (IR) sensors
4. Jumper Wires
5. 12V power supply

The Arduino Uno acts as the brain of the robot, receiving inputs from the IR sensors and controlling the motors via the L298N motor driver. The L298N motor driver is responsible for controlling the speed and direction of the motors connected to the robot's wheels.

The IR sensors are placed on the bottom side of the robot, facing the ground. These sensors emit infrared light and detect the reflected light. By analyzing the reflected light intensity, the IR sensors can determine whether the robot is on the line or off the line. Based on this information, the Arduino Uno can make decisions about motor control to keep the robot following the line.

The line follower robot operates using a simple algorithm. When the IR sensors detect that the robot is off the line, the Arduino Uno adjusts the motor speeds and directions to steer the robot back onto the line. By continuously adjusting the motor control based on the sensor readings, the robot can successfully follow the line's path.

To implement this project, you would need to connect the IR sensors and the L298N motor driver to the Arduino Uno following the appropriate wiring connections. Then, you would write and upload the Arduino code that reads the sensor inputs, processes them, and controls the motors using the L298N motor driver module.

Line follower robots are popular educational projects that introduce concepts such as sensor interfacing, motor control, and basic autonomous navigation. They can be further enhanced with additional features, such as obstacle avoidance or line intersection detection, to make them more versatile and capable.
